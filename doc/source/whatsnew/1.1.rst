What's New In python-apt 1.1
==============================
This release is built against APT 1.1

Changed
-------
* Starting with *1.1.0~beta1ubuntu0.16.04.2*, depcache stops accepting
  objects belonging to a different cache; and candidates need to belong
  to the package they are being set for. This was necessary to avoid
  out-of-bounds indexes, but might break existing applications.

  For :class:`apt.cache.Cache`, objects are remapped automatically
  when reopening to reduce the impact.

Removed
-------
* The class :class:`apt_pkg.IndexRecords` has been removed, as it was removed
  in APT 1.1


1.1.0~beta1ubuntu0.16.04.3
--------------------------
* New methods for frontend locking have been added:
  :meth:`apt_pkg.pkgsystem_lock_inner`,
  :meth:`apt_pkg.pkgsystem_unlock_inner`,
  :meth:`apt_pkg.pkgsystem_is_locked`.x
* :meth:`apt.Cache.commit` and :meth:`apt_pkg.DepCache.commit` now use
  frontend locking to run dpkg.

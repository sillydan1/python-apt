* The constructor :class:`apt_pkg.AcquireFile` now accepts an
  :class:`apt_pkg.HashStringList` as the *hash* argument.

Removed
-------
* The methods called `install_protect` have been removed
* The `section` attribute has been removed from :class:`apt_pkg.Package`
  and :class:`apt.package.Package`
* The method :meth:`apt_pkg.rewrite_section` has been removed

* The constructor :class:`apt_pkg.AcquireFile` no longer takes an *md5* argument.

Changed

  None where it previously contained the md5 hash.
